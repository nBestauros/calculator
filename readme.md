# Pure HTML/CSS JS Calculator

## Introduction
As part of my self-driven effort to learn web development, I built a four-function calculator using pure HTML/CSS and Javascript.

You can try the calculator for yourself [here](https://nbestauros.github.io/calculator/).
## What I Learned
### CSS
I gained experience using grids, positioning, and element sizing based upon window size.
### Javascript
I utilized Javascript to add listners to the calculator buttons, as well as handle the calculator logic, including edge cases such as divide by zero errors and floating point precision.
